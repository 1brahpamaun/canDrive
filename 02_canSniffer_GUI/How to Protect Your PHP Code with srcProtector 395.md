srcProtector 3.95 is a tool that encrypts your PHP code and makes it unreadable and unmodifiable. It works by changing the structure of your code, renaming variables, functions, classes, constants, and strings, removing comments and whitespaces, and optionally packing the code into an eval expression.
 
Unlike some other PHP encryption tools that require special loaders or extensions on the server, srcProtector 3.95 does not have any special requirements for the encoded applications. They run on any server that supports PHP up to version 5.6. You can also lock your applications to specific domain names or set expiration dates for them.
 
srcProtector 3.95 has a simple graphical user interface that allows you to select files, check settings, and run the encoder with a few clicks. It also has a sophisticated code analysis engine that warns you about potential issues in your code that might affect the functionality of the encoded application.
 
srcProtector 3.95 supports both object-oriented and procedural programming styles, as well as popular frameworks and content management systems such as Zend Framework, CodeIgniter, Symfony, and Joomla.
 
If you want to try srcProtector 3.95 for yourself, you can download a free demo version from [https://phpobfuscator.net/](https://phpobfuscator.net/). The demo version allows you to encode up to 5 files at once. To encode bigger projects, you need to purchase a license for $99.
 
srcProtector 3.95 is a great solution for PHP developers who want to protect their intellectual property and prevent unauthorized use of their code. With srcProtector 3.95, you can rest assured that your code is safe and secure.
  
How does srcProtector 3.95 work? srcProtector 3.95 uses a combination of techniques to obfuscate your PHP code and make it impossible to reverse-engineer. First, it parses your code and creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the logic and structure of your code. Then, it applies various transformations to the AST, such as renaming identifiers, replacing literals with expressions, removing comments and whitespaces, and changing the order of statements. Finally, it generates a new PHP code from the modified AST that preserves the functionality of your original code but looks completely different and incomprehensible.
 
What are the benefits of using srcProtector 3.95? srcProtector 3.95 offers many benefits for PHP developers who want to protect their code from unauthorized access and modification. Some of the benefits are:
 
- It increases the security of your code by making it harder for hackers, crackers, or competitors to steal, copy, or modify your code.
- It protects your intellectual property rights by preventing your customers from redistributing or reselling your code without your permission.
- It enhances your reputation and credibility by showing your customers that you care about the quality and security of your code.
- It saves you time and money by reducing the need for legal actions or technical support for your code.
